              We are three founders who have spent our careers building at the frontier of artificial intelligence — designing large-scale platforms and shipping AI products used by millions. We came together around a shared conviction: some of the biggest decisions people make in their lives are still being made with tools that feel decades behind. None more so than buying a home.
            </p>

            <p>
              This company was born from frustration as much as ambition. Each of us has lived through the home buying journey ourselves — the stale listings, the spreadsheets that never capture what matters, the gut-feel calls on neighborhoods, the opaque pricing, the seven-figure decisions made on information that is always one step out of date. We have felt, personally, how one of life’s most exciting moments quietly becomes one of its most exhausting. The technology to fix this exists; it just has not been pointed at the problem.
            </p>

            <p className="font-medium text-black">
              So we are pointing it there.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are building an AI-native experience for property search and home ownership — one that understands what you actually want, surfaces the trade-offs you would otherwise discover only weeks in, and stays with you from first search through closing and beyond. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Our goal is simple: take the tools we have spent our careers building for the world’s hardest technical problems, and put them in the hands of everyone looking for a place to call home.
            </p>
